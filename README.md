# Ruby on Rails + Semantic UI + React

Little experiment using this three technologies. I hope this example is useful to somebody =)

## TIL
* Some INPUTS, like checkbox, are 'masked' by DIVs when used with Semantic UI, so yo cannot access directly to the INPUT.
* Due to JSX, some Semantic UI are not initilized correctly when used insidea React component. This initialization must be done inside `componentDidUpdate` or something like that.
* `simple_form` is a very nice tool, but it's a little tricky when used with Semantic UI. You can see that in the Productos form.
